-- Ahead
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Lookahead streams can execute multiple tasks concurrently, ahead of time,
-- but always serve them in the same order as they appear in the stream. To
-- implement lookahead streams efficiently we assign a sequence number to each
-- task when the task is picked up for execution. When the task finishes, the
-- output is tagged with the same sequence number and we rearrange the outputs
-- in sequence based on that number.
--
-- To explain the mechanism imagine that the current task at the head of the
-- stream has a "token" to yield to the outputQueue. The ownership of the token
-- is determined by the current sequence number is maintained in outputHeap.
-- Sequence number is assigned when a task is queued. When a thread dequeues a
-- task it picks up the sequence number as well and when the output is ready it
-- uses the sequence number to queue the output to the outputQueue.
--
-- The thread with current sequence number sends the output directly to the
-- outputQueue. Other threads push the output to the outputHeap. When the task
-- being queued on the heap is a stream of many elements we evaluate only the
-- first element and keep the rest of the unevaluated computation in the heap.
-- When such a task gets the "token" for outputQueue it evaluates and directly
-- yields all the elements to the outputQueue without checking for the
-- "token".
--
-- Note that no two outputs in the heap can have the same sequence numbers and
-- therefore we do not need a stable heap. We have also separated the buffer
-- for the current task (outputQueue) and the pending tasks (outputHeap) so
-- that the pending tasks cannot interfere with the current task. Note that for
-- a single task just the outputQueue is enough and for the case of many
-- threads just a heap is good enough. However we balance between these two
-- cases, so that both are efficient.
--
-- For bigger streams it may make sense to have separate buffers for each
-- stream. However, for singleton streams this may become inefficient. However,
-- if we do not have separate buffers, then the streams that come later in
-- sequence may hog the buffer, hindering the streams that are ahead. For this
-- reason we have a single element buffer limitation for the streams being
-- executed in advance.
--
-- This scheme works pretty efficiently with less than 40% extra overhead
-- compared to the Async streams where we do not have any kind of sequencing of
-- the outputs. It is especially devised so that we are most efficient when we
-- have short tasks and need just a single thread. Also when a thread yields
-- many items it can hold lockfree access to the outputQueue and do it
-- efficiently.
--
-- XXX Maybe we can start the ahead threads at a lower cpu and IO priority so
-- that they do not hog the resources and hinder the progress of the threads in
-- front of them.

-- Left associated ahead expressions are expensive. We start a new SVar for
-- each left associative expression. The queue is used only for right
-- associated expression, we queue the right expression and execute the left.
-- Thererefore the queue never has more than on item in it.
--
-- XXX Also note that limiting concurrency for cases like "take 10" would not
-- work well with left associative expressions, because we have no visibility
-- about how much the left side of the expression would yield.
--
-- XXX It may be a good idea to increment sequence numbers for each yield,
-- currently a stream on the left side of the expression may yield many
-- elements with the same sequene number. We can then use the seq number to
-- enforce yieldMax and yieldLImit as well.

-- Invariants:
--
-- * A worker should always ensure that it pushes all the consecutive items in
-- the heap to the outputQueue especially the items on behalf of the workers
-- that have already left when we were holding the token. This avoids deadlock
-- conditions when the later workers completion depends on the consumption of
-- earlier results. For more details see comments in the consumer pull side
-- code.

-- XXX In absence of a "noyield" primitive (i.e. do not pre-empt inside a
-- critical section) from GHC RTS, we have a difficult problem. Assume we have
-- a 100,000 threads producing output and queuing it to the heap for
-- sequencing. The heap can be drained only by one thread at a time, any thread
-- that finds that heap can be drained now, takes a lock and starts draining
-- it, however the thread may get prempted in the middle of it holding the
-- lock. Since that thread is holding the lock, the other threads cannot pick
-- up the draining task, therefore they proceed to picking up the next task to
-- execute. If the draining thread could yield voluntarily at a point where it
-- has released the lock, then the next threads could pick up the draining
-- instead of executing more tasks. When there are 100,000 threads the drainer
-- gets a cpu share to run only 1:100000 of the time. This makes the heap
-- accumulate a lot of output when we the buffer size is large.
--
-- The solutions to this problem are:
-- 1) make the other threads wait in a queue until the draining finishes
-- 2) make the other threads queue and go away if draining is in progress
--
-- In both cases we give the drainer a chance to run more often.
